LCAjava: For my familiar programming language I chose java. I researched various solutions based on my experience with binary search trees and I settled on the one linked below.

Testing instructions:
Create a new java project in eclipse
Name the project LCA
Select NEXT and uncheck “Create module-info.java file”
Add LCAjava.java and LCAtest.java to the scr
File new Junit-test-case (Name it whatever, this just allows you to add JUnit to the build path)
Delete the Junit-test-case you just created
Run as a junit test

LCAhs: When I picked a new programming language I thought it would be a good idea to get a head start on learning haskell. I researched possible solutions online and I incorporated the one linked below. I tried researching and testing different testing frame works for haskell testing but no tutorial I found worked with my machine and the code I had. Within the past few weeks another lecturer has provided me with a stack test set up to run haskell tests. I used the cabal file from this set up for running LCA.hs and Spec.hs (the test file associated with LCA).

Testing instructions in terminal:
stack build
stack test
