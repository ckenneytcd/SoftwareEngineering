1. I took the solution from Geeks for geeks* for the lowest common ancestor using the binary search tree.
2. I went through the java version first to understand the concept since I am experienced in java.
3. I took their c++ version, which is a new language for me, and made annotated the comparisons and contrasts to the java version.
